# Shopping List Manager made with .NET, Angular, SQL and Google Auth!

It is possible to add items to the list, remove them, select a quantity and mark items as important.
Once items are bought it is possible to add them to a "previously bought" list which allows you to re-buy them and add them back to your list!

Easy SQL implementation, just connect your DB and you're ready to go :)
